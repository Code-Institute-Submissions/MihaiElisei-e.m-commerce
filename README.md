* The site structure is designed considering the expectation of users to be simple and easy to use;
* The user interface is easy to navigate;

# 1.3 Color Scheme

The choice of website right foreground and background colour is essential that decides the site visitors wheather to emote the site or not. I used [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) to select the background and foreground color. Colors that i used are:

* the content it`s mostly blank and white and because the app will store many images it will take the colors from them;
* and some bootstrp5 colors: warning, info, primary, alert

# 1.4 Images and Logo

This website was created for academic purposes, all photos were searched and downloaded from [Giphy website](https://giphy.com/) and [Google search](https://google.com/)

# 1.5 Site Skeleton

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes of the website. This was very useful as it gives the template of the UI. Wireframes were designed for web browser and a mobile browser format:
